To check the permission of the file or folder, follow these steps:\na.Right-click the file or folder, and then select Properties.\nb.Select the Security tab.\nc.Under Group or User names, click your name to see the permissions you have.\nd.Select Edit, and then select to check the check boxes for the permissions that you need, and then select OK.\nFor more information on permissions, see http://windows.microsoft.com/windows7/what-are-permissions\n\nMethod 2: Check the file location\nYou might get this error if the shortcut or installation is attempting to access a location that is not currently available such as a networked or a removable drive. Check the path of the file that Windows cannot access and make sure that the location is accessible.\n\nMethod 3: Make sure that the file has not been moved or deleted\nYou can also receive this error if the file has been moved or deleted. Browse to the location of the file and make sure the file is in that location.\n\nMethod 4: Unblock the file\nIn some cases the file may be blocked by Windows. Check the properties of the file, there may be a note saying This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer To check for and unblock the file, follow these steps:\na.Right-click the blocked file and then select Properties.\nb.In the General tab, select Unblock if the option is available.\n\nMethod 5: Check to see if your antivirus software is blocking the file\nYou can check to see if your antivirus software is blocking a file by temporarily disabling it, and then trying to open the file. If you have to temporarily disable your antivirus software, you should re-enable it as soon as you are done. If youâ€™re connected to the Internet while your antivirus software is disabled, your PC is vulnerable to attacks.\nImportant: Disabling your antivirus software or changing the settings may make your PC vulnerable to viral, fraudulent, or malicious attacks. Microsoft does not recommend that you disable your antivirus software or change the settings.  If you have to temporarily disable your antivirus software, you should re-enable it as soon as you are done. Use this workaround at your own risk. To temporarily disable your antivirus software, see http://windows.microsoft.com/windows7/disable-antivirus-software."
